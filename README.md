Smart parking notification
Basically my idea is to provide a location of the parking details such as,
1.	Parking location- It is difficult to identify our own vehicle as were we have parked in some hilly areas or outer ring roads. It will be easy if we can able to identify our vehicle as where we have parked by using Google map & save our live vehicle location in efficient way. 
For such identification of vehicle parking can use machine learning technique as by training the models & for providing live captions for path finder.
2.	Parking suggestion- As a user point of view need to know where exactly i can park my vehicle is there any place to park my vehicle instead knowing it later no place to park my vehicle after reaching there. Giving suggestion to end users by
a. highly secure- paid parking 
b. safe- free parking but safe 
c. unsafe- free but unsafe 
Providing a safe & secure location to park the user vehicle & to trace back with the same location to the user vehicle by even providing captions is the main motto.

These techniques can be achieved by training the models through machine learning technique collecting from the database. The concept here is the user has to on the Google map enabled with the GPS location so that the trips made from A to B are stored in the cloud. We predict the parking location when the user slows down the vehicle to around 15 -20 kmpl.
